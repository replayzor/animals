# ADD ANIMALS APP

This app is a simple React application that displays a random animal when the "Add Animal" button is clicked. 
The app uses the "bulma" CSS library for styling and the "useState" hook
The app also imports a custom "AnimalShow" component that takes in an "animal" prop and displays the animal along with a heart icon that changes width when clicked.
